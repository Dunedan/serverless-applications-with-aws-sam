This repository contains slides and code samples used for my "Serverless
applications with AWS SAM" talk I gave at the [Serverless Hamburg meetup][1]
and the [Hamburg AWS User Group][2].

The slides are available at: https://dunedan.github.io/serverless-applications-with-aws-sam/

There is also a great talk by Chris Munns from AWS about SAM:
